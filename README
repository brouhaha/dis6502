dis6502 is a flow-tracing disassembler for the 6502, originally written
by Robert Bond and supporting Atari binary files.  Robert posted dis6502
to the Usenet newsgroup net.sources on 9-Oct-1986, and to
comp.sources.unix 7-Jun-1988.  Udi Finkelstein ported dis6502 to the
Amiga, added support for Commodore 64 object files, and posted it to
comp.sources.amiga on 4-Nov-1988.  These versions were in the public
domain.

This version of dis6502 has been modified in several ways:

* Can read raw binary files.

* Option to specify alternate reset and interrupt vector addresses.

* Line numbers are no longer necessary with equates in definition files.

* If a data reference is made to an address that does not have an
  assigned name, but address-1 does, the reference will be disassembled
  as name+1.  This is convenient for two-byte variables, particularly in
  zero page.

* New definition file directives:

        <name> .equ <addr>                     same as .eq

               .jtab2 <addr>,<addr>,<count>    table of code pointers, split
                                               into high and low byte tables

               .rtstab <addr>,<addr>,<count>   like jtab2, but each entry
					       contains the target address
					       minus one, for use with RTS

* Rather than using recursive calls to trace every instruction, there is
  now a trace queue.

* Added a "-7" option to mask off MSB of character data.

* Updated to use ANSI C function prototypes and include files.

* Amiga/Manx changes have been removed.

dis6502 has been tested on Red Hat Linux 9, but should work on other
Linux, BSD, and Unix systems.
